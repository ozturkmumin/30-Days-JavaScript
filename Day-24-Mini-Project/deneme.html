                                                  price is often below the market price. This is the difference between the bid and the asking price
                                                  that shows the current and actual spread in the forex market and the additional spread added by the
                                                  forex broker. Lower (tighter) spreads are preferred by the traders because it makes the trade less
                                                  expensive. It also shows that the currency pair is highly liquid and not so volatile, which makes
                                                  the trade less risky. If the market is very volatile and not very liquid, it is possible to see wide
                                                  (high) spreads. We ensure that our customers are satisfied with the lowest spreads at Wave Capitals

                                             <h2>What is Leverage in Forex Trading?</h2>
                                             <p>
                                                  When trading, forex leverage allows traders to control a larger position with less of their own
                                                  funds. It allows traders to make more volume transactions by money requirement which is usually
                                                  ‘borrowed’ from the forex broker. Traders can usually get more leverage on forex than other
                                                  financial instruments. So, they can control a larger sum of money with a smaller deposit.
                                                  <br /><br />
                                                  Here is an example to understand the leverage procedure: Imagine that you have a 1.000 USD deposit
                                                  and want to invest worth 100.000 USD. In this scenario, your leverage ratio is 1:100, which means
                                                  you control 100 times higher than your main deposit. A 1% rise means a 1.000 USD gain while a 1%
                                                  drop means there is nothing left. So, a forex trader should always consider the risk associated with
                                                  leverage.
